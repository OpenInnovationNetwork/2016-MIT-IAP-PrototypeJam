{"project_name":"Glasnost","project_blurb":"Glasnost is an easy-to-use, blockchain-based bulletin board for information about censorship worldwide. In the never-ending cat-and-mouse game of censors fighting to constrain information flows, Glasnost is a tool to aid those who fight censorship. Anyone can upload the name, type, and country of a censored item, and be assured it will survive. This information can then help target anti-censorship resources at the neediest media and locations. And though the blockchain may not be accessible to all, it cannot be deleted. The world can be assured that the truth will be etched in stone forever.","project_team_name":"","project_thumbnail":"https://hackdash.org/uploads/c3c61e4fe9b6cb08e679fab4b994c291.png","project_url":"https://hackdash.org/projects/5691953762b2cc5d050af6ea","project_demo_url":"http://glasnost.press/"}

{"project_name":"Team Binary (StoryCreator)","project_blurb":"Hello all! It is a TEXT GAME ENGINE, which helps its users easily create their text games to tell their own story! Books are static. for a book, the story and the ending never change once it is done. however, for a game (let's say text game), it provides its players different game experiences(stories) and endings. It is a perfect tool to tell a story, to tell an dynamic story! the story could change based on its readers' feedbacks(like feelings, suggestions, etc) at certain points. for instance, after reading the beginning, I feel excited (feedback!), and I would read something different in the next part from someone who feels sad after reading the beginning.

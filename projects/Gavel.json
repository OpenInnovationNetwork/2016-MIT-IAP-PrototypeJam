{"project_name":"Gavel","project_blurb":"\n\nYou might be familiar with the tired old adage: \"You can't judge a book by its cover.\" Well Gavel is an android app that aims to turn that notion on its head. With Gavel, a user can capture an image of the cover of any book, and Gavel will [via RIS] identify key information about that book, such as the the Title, Author, and ISBN. Using this information, Gavel polls a variety of sources to gather data on pricing, as well as multiple sets of reviews (where possible). All of this data is collated and presented to the user in a beautiful format, truly allowing them to \"judge\" books without ever turning a page.","project_team_name":"","project_thumbnail":"https://hackdash.org/uploads/026b1b23522e8a9f0e53470963112cca.png","project_url":"https://hackdash.org/projects/5691d06c62b2cc5d050af700","project_demo_url":""}

{"project_name":"BorderlessFic","project_blurb":"\n\nWe envision BorderlessFic to be an online platform that combines publishing your own original fiction or fan fiction and voluntarily translating works by fellow users that are in different languages. Our goal is to try to break down the language barrier and allow online writers to share their works and interests with people all around the world. We hope to build a tight-knit community of warm hearted, talented and enthusiastic writers/translators. Features include posting stories, commenting, viewing stories, filtering stories, online translating, etc.","project_team_name":"","project_thumbnail":"https://hackdash.org/uploads/4a686cdc20e4f758654be544e494a815.png","project_url":"https://hackdash.org/projects/56920e1662b2cc5d050af707","project_demo_url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JAZ114DxumnVsLxrja3QVX85ouFRPExi9GI0jDtOLyM/edit#slide=id.p"}

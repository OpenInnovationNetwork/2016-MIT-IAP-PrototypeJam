{"project_name":"LitCity","project_blurb":"\nImagine walking down a city street and feeling that familiar buzz of a push notification. But instead of it being a notification on Twitter or a restaurant recommendation, it's a beautiful passage from a work of literature with a tie to that place.\n\nIn Paris, it could be walking past Cafe de Flore and receiving a sample from James Baldwin or Richard Wright. In Washington, DC, it could be a sample of an Alex Cross novel. In Japan, it could be one of Miyuke Miyabe's mystery novels. In Chicago, it could be a bit from Devil in the White City.\nThe core idea is to inject a little bit of romance and discoverability into books. Not only is the reader given a beautiful prompt to reflect upon (contributing to the mental environment) but it also is a wondrous reminder that literature lives wherever we are.
